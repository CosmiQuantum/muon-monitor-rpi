# muon-monitor-rpi
RPi code and documentation for running the muon monitor at NEXUS

When stacking the PMTs, from top to bottom, PMT 15 should be on top, PMT 9 should be in the middle, and PMT 14 should be on the bottom.
When plugging in the signal cables from the PMT to the Linear Fan-in/Fan-out Module, ensure that, from top to bottom, you connect PMT 9, then PMT 14, then finally PMT 15.
